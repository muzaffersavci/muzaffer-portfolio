I am currently a 3rd-year Computer Engineering student at Istanbul Rumeli University. Additionally, I am a 5th-term scholar at the Artificial Intelligence and Technology Academy in the Artificial Intelligence department.\n\nI am building my career path around Artificial Intelligence development and modern software technologies. While I enjoy solving complex problems through code, life for me isn't just about screens. I owe my discipline to sports and my creativity to music. I play the guitar, piano, and bağlama proficiently. I am also an avid sports enthusiast and participant. I believe in continuous improvement, both in the digital world and in real life.",
